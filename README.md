# Melonama_detection_assignment
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma 
has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

Goal: Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset.

Results:

Model is a moderately accurate with training accuracy of 77% and validation accuracy of 71%. 

Technology Used: Pyhton packages: tensorflow, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pathlib, os
